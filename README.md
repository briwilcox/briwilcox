Hi there 👋

🚀 I'm a passionate product manager, focusing on creating products that protect and delight customers.

🎓 I'm diving deep into machine learning and AI, especially applied to security, anti-fraud, and investing. Also reading about infosec, health, longevity, automated farming, history, and philosophy.

🤝 I'm eager to collaborate on projects related to any of the topics I'm learning about.

📚 I'm seeking suggestions for my next read or writing topic.

💡 Feel free to ask me about computer security, machine learning, investing, and health.
